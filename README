omapd is an open source implementation of the IF-MAP v1.1 specification
published by the Trusted Computing Group [1].

To build omapd, you will need a Qt development environment [2].  Initial
development of omapd was built against Qt v4.5.2.  Development as of
omapd-0.3.0 is using Qt v4.6.2, and minimum of Qt v4.6.0 is required because of
the QXmlStream classes.  Run qmake on the omapd.pro file, then run make.
