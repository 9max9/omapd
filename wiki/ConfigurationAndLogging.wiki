#summary Describes omapd's RESTful configuration and logging API

== Introduction ==

The following is the existing URI layout of omapd's configuration and logging HTTP API. It's based on RESTful concepts, although it isn't entirely RESTful.


=== Logging ===

{{{GET /logs}}}
return a list of available logs and their URIs
{{{GET /logs/protocol}}}
return a list of all protocol (i.e. xml/soap message) logs and their URIs, or if there is only one, return it
{{{GET /logs/protocol/requests, /logs/protocol/response, etc}}}
return sliced logs
{{{GET /logs/debug, etc}}}
return other levels of logging information. need help here since i'm not familiar with what other omapd log info is useful

{{{GET /logs/<path>?tail=n}}}
return the last n log messages

experimental feature: use websockets to present realtime logging through the browser (would only work in chrome and ff 3.7)
