= Introduction =

omapd was written in C++ using the Qt Framework from Nokia.  Current omapd development is using Qt v4.6.2, and v4.6.0 is a minimum version because of some of the QXmlStreamReader methods.  Note that Qt is a multi-platform product, and it hides the details of the underlying operating system from the programmer.  omapd was initially written on a Linux platform, but, using the Qt SDK, it should build and run on any other platform Qt supports.


= Details =

You will need to download a [http://qt.nokia.com/downloads Qt SDK development environment] and install it on your computer.

Once you have the Qt SDK installed, get a version of omapd to play with.

Now you have a couple options:
  # Use `QtCreator`  to open the omapd.pro file in the omapd source tree.  Build and run.
  # Run qmake (part of the Qt SDK) on the omapd.pro file
   * This creates a Makefile
   * Then type make
   * Then execute omapd: ./omapd
