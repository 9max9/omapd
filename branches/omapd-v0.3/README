omapd is an open source implementation of the IF-MAP v1.1 specification
published by the Trusted Computing Group [1].

To build omapd, you will need a Qt development environment [2].  Initial
development of omapd was built against Qt v4.5.2.  Run qmake on the omapd.pro
file, then run make.

This implementation also leverages the qtsoap-2.6 opensource Qt Solution
package [3] as a basis for SOAP messages and namespaces.  The qtsoap-2.6
package had several shortcomings that had to be addressed before use.  Most
notably these included: no support for attributes in SOAP XML elements.  These
changes should be submitted to Qt for inclusion in the qtsoap package.  The
original source files are included in this distribution.
